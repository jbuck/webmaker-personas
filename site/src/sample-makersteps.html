<h2>Let&rsquo;s make a meme</h2>

<div>
  <p>
    <strong>A &ldquo;meme&rdquo; is something that&rsquo;s shared on the
      internet, and it usually has three parts</strong>: a picture, a caption,
    and a dash of humor. In this activity, you&rsquo;ll make your own meme using
    a bit of HTML and your own creativity.
